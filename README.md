# Show the Local Weather

This is a "Free Code Camp" challenge where you have to build a web app to show the local Weather.

The app has to have similar funcionality to this one -> [Example](http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV)

While developing the app, I had to fulfill the requirements below:

* I can see the weather in my current location.
* I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
* I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## How to run the app locally in your machine.

* Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* Install "Bower" globally on your machine `npm install -g bower`
* Clone this repository on your machine
* `cd` into the folder and run `npm install`
* Run `bower install`
* Run `npm start`
* Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
